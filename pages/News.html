	<p class="paragraph"><span class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold" style="margin-right: -15px; margin-bottom:-10px ;color:red; font-size: 50px"> D </span>ays Gone's development has not been easy for Bend Studio. First revealed during E3 2016, it was then delayed multiple times to get the game polished up. While delays ultimately are a good thing,
  the mixed preview and delays don't go hand to hand which understandably causes some concerns. Now that everyone has finally got their hands on the final release of the game, it makes sense why the game was delayed so much both good and bad.
  Let's start with the good first. At a glance, Days Gone isn't exactly a looker compared to some recent open titles. But upon closer inspection it tells a much different story,
  unlike most games which went for a more bright color pallet to make their worlds pop, Days Gone opted for a much cooler tone which lends itself very nicely to the realistic approach the game is taking.
  Lush greens scattered throughout the world, cars abandoned on the roads, combined with the dynamic weather as well as the excellent day and night cycle, the final product is just as impressive as other recent open world titles. Still,
  all that visual fidelity does not come cheap and I will get into that later. </p>

	<p class="paragraph"> If I was to describe Days Gone's story it had to be a slow burner with some great moments sprinkled in between. The initial hours of the story were a chore to go through. It was dragged on and on for a little bit too long with filler missions that don't lead to anything much. The experience can be made even worse with abrupt cuts or fade to black moments immediately followed by a loading screen which some are even longer than the cutscene itself. It felt like a cheaply made game at times and not from a triple-A budget game. The experience in the early hours nearly got me to stop playing the game. In my opinion, some missions can be filtered out in favor of much more emphasis on some other characters that did not get enough attention. But, one thing that stayed consistent from start to finish is the core relationship between Deacon and his wife Sarah and to some extent his best friend Boozer. Deacon is quite an interesting character to say the least, he seems disinterested most of the time so he does give off the impression of a dick sometimes but there's a good reason for that. He's still mourning over his wife's death and he partially blames himself for it. Through a series of flashback scenes, you got to see their relationship in play and it helps to empathize with the pain that Deacon is going through. When hints start showing up a possibility about his wife still alive, you want to help him see it through which what drives the game's whole narrative. </p>

	<p class="paragraph"> A world is only going to be as interesting as its content and thankfully Days Gone has it in spades. Clearing marauder camps, infestation nests, finding NERO checkpoints are some of the activities that fill up the world of Days Gone. It doesn't sound like the most exciting activities but it does its job well enough and it is for the most part optional. Each of these activities does give out worthwhile rewards ranging from new crafting items to upgrades for your character, giving you incentives to do them. Other than that, it also gives you an access point to fast travel around which is super handy seeing how big the world is. Funds and trusts can also be earned by completing activities around which contribute towards gaining access to new parts and equipment and spending on them. Doing these over and over again can start to feel a bit samey at times especially if the story hasn't picked up some steam but the surprisingly good gameplay makes the gameplay loop fun. Satisfying gunplay, gruesome melee combat system, scavenging for items to craft for health, bombs, repairs kept me engaged throughout my 40 to 50 hour so journey. While I was fine with the activities being what it is, I was disappointed to find out that the jobs you get in camps are largely uninspired and a wasted opportunity. This is about as close as you can get to a side mission, and it just tumbles all over itself. Take the quest, search for clues, ends with a bike chase if they need the target alive, or ends with a gunfight if they want the target dead. There is some form of context was given in regards to the target but it never really matters because you do not even get to decide the fate of the target and it just ends. </p>

	<p class="paragraph"> In Days Gone, traveling around will take up most of your playtime and your bike will be your greatest asset. Similar to your character, your bike skills will gradually become better in both your understanding of the game's physics as well as the upgrades applied to it. You feel yourself getting better grips with the ins and outs of your bike allowing you to pull off advanced maneuvers that u might not have when you started. In a way, it felt similar to the horse in Red Dead Redemption 2 but obviously with bikes. Always keep an eye out on your bike's fuel and its condition so it doesn't fail you when you needed it the most. Fast travel also consumes fuel so it is required that you plan to avoid running out of gas. There are other factors in play like bikes tend to produce more noise so always stop just before you objective to avoid attracting unwanted attention but not too far to leave an escape plan available. While all of these are necessary to ensure you get the most out of your bike, and luckily, it is not up to the point that it is annoying and it just becomes second nature. </p>

	<p class="paragraph"> There's one particular activity that I left out intentionally is dealing with the hordes. One of the main draws of Days Gone when it was first revealed was seeing the enormous group of zombies sprinting full speed towards Deacon like the kids at break time during school. Sure we have seen similar games that have pulled this off particularly the recent World War Z, but what I liked about this in particular, is that Days Gone adds a survival element to the mix. Because some of the hordes spawn dynamically, you are not always in an advantageous position to take on the horde so it's up to you to decide to fight or flee. Even with a fully stock weapon in your hands, it's almost impossible to just mow them so it's recommended that you survey the area to plan routes to pick, traps to set. The game is designed well enough that you had just enough to defeat them creating a surge of an adrenaline rush when going up against what looked like impossible odds.</p>

	<p class="paragraph"> As much as I have been praising the game, for the most part, this is in my opinion, the biggest problem of the game - the technical issues. Granted, the issues are undoubtedly varied from one user to another but I pretty sure got the short end of the stick. Audio bugs, zombies disappearing randomly, hordes spawning right in front of me giving me zero time to react which of course leads to death, inconsistent AI that couldn't navigate the simplest of terrain even friendlies got stuck requiring me to restart. Frame rate that dips into slide show levels of bad going into camps but surprisingly rare instances when facing hordes. The load times that are generally on the longer side which would be fine if the game didn't keep freezing for a second or two to load again. That is still probably more that I can't recall on the top of my head but my point is by itself it doesn't seem like much but altogether it does hinder my enjoyment from the game. </p>

	<p class="paragraph">While rough around the edges, I still had a great time playing Days Gone. The beautiful world, the story while very slow won me over eventually, The vicious combat leads helps with the satisfying gameplay loop although can be a tad bit repetitive. It's such a shame that the game is plagued with so many technical issues that can be rather infuriating to deal with. Still, this is a great road ahead for whatâ€™s to come should Bend Studio decide to make another sequel. </p>

	<p class="paragraph"> Final Score 7/10 </p>
